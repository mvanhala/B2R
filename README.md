B2R provides an R interface to some of the functionality in the [Backblaze B2 API](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/). Not all of the API is supported: in particular, functions for uploading large files in parts are not implemented. B2R contains functions for listing buckets and files, downloading files, and uploading files.

See Phill Clarke's `backblazer` ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=backblazer), [Github](https://github.com/phillc73/backblazer)) for an existing package with bindings to the Backblaze B2 API.
